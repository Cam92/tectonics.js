<h2>CONTACTS</h2>
<h3>The Developer</h3>
	<p>If all else fails, <a href="mailto:diadophus@gmail.com">drop me a line</a> and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.</p>

	<p>Tectonics.js is a spotlight project. I work on it whenever I have enough time to give it my sole attention. Please be patient when posting feature requests.</p>

<h3>Predecessors</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="http://pytectonics.sourceforge.net/">PyTectonics</a></dt>
		<dd>The earlier project for which Tectonics.js replaces. Requires Python.</dd>
		<dt><a href="http://markjstock.org/pages/builder.html">Plates</a></dt>
		<dd>Originally a direct descendant, pyTectonics began as a python port for the Plates model. 
		It has since been rewritten to the point the two share little in common.</dd>
		<dt><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/platec">PlaTec</a></dt>
		<dd>In a case of convergent evolution, pyTeconics has come to adopt several methods
		similar to those in PlaTec. Plates, for instance, are respresented in both models as grids on which 
		cells are mapped to represent crust. 
		Nevertheless, PlaTec remains a 2D model with all the costs and benefits that imparts.</dd>
