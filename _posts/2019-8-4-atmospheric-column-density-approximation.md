So there's been an improvement to atmospheric scattering that I want to share. You'll want to make sure to read [Alan Zucconi's series](https://www.alanzucconi.com/2017/10/10/atmospheric-scattering-1/) on scattering if you're not familiar with the topic. Also read the earlier blog post on [Fast atmosphere scattering](http://davidson16807.github.io/tectonics.js//2019/03/24/fast-atmospheric-scattering.html) to get yourself acquainted with the problem I'm dealing with. 

We're basically trying to solve this integral:

<p>`I = int_A^L exp(-(sqrt(x^2 + z^2) - R)/H) dx`</p>

<img align="right" src="http://davidson16807.github.io/tectonics.js/blog/diagrams/atmospheric-scattering-variables.svg" width="61%">

Like many integrals, it has no closed form solution. We have to make approximations.

I've come to learn a few people have worked on this problem before. [Christian Schüler](http://www.thetenthplanet.de/about) was the first person I'm aware of. He wrote a [chapter](https://books.google.com/books?id=aG3y7WQGzmQC&lpg=PA111&ots=IwfuZVpsLr&dq=GPU%20Pro%203%20has%20arrived%20chapman&pg=PA105#v=onepage&q&f=false) of a book that described an approximation for what's known as the "Chapman function". The Chapman function is a related concept. It effectively measures the relative density of particles in the atmosphere, just like we're doing, however it does so using a different method signature. Rather than work with 2d cartesian coordinates relative to the center of the world, it works with viewing angle and altitude. I've found this method signature to be less convenient to work into a classical raymarch algorithm, since for every step of the raymarch I have to calculate an angle relative to the zenith for that step. For that reason I've never gotten around to implementing it. 

The approximation I made [last time](http://davidson16807.github.io/tectonics.js//2019/03/24/fast-atmospheric-scattering.html) doesn't have that problem, but I couldn't escape the nagging feeling that it lacked mathematical elegance. The problem it was trying to prevent was a division by zero. The division by zero occurred when you naïvely solved the integral using integration by substitution:

<p>`int_A^L exp(-(sqrt(x^2 + z^2) - R)/H) dx approx -H sqrt(x^2 + z^2)/x exp((sqrt(x^2 + z^2) - R)/H)`</p>

There was a distance function used to calculate height, and when you swapped it out for a stretched-out quadratic height approximation, you could make sure that division by zero never occurs in the region of interest. But that required defining a region of interest, so we setup some arbitrary fractions a and b from which the slope and intercept for the quadratic approximation could be sampled. 

And that's why it felt so ugly. You had to pick some value for the magic constants a and b, they had to work well together, and they had to work well *for every planet in the universe.*

So I kept revisiting the problem, more than I probably should have, and eventually I was able to reason my way to a better solution. 

My first insight was to reduce the number of parameters to consider. I realized that if all distances (both input and output) were expressed in scale heights, we could do away with H:

<p>`int_A^L exp(R-sqrt(x^2 + z^2)) dx approx -sqrt(x^2 + z^2)/x exp(R-sqrt(x^2 + z^2))`</p>

<p>I then thought about what would happen in certain situations. When `z=R` and `x=0`, the behavior for height:</p>

<p>`h(x,z,R) = sqrt(x^2 + z^2) - R`</p>

begins to resemble a parabola:

<p>`h(0,R,R) approx approx x^2 - R`</p>

in which case the integral is proportionate to the [error function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function):

<p>`int_A^L exp(R-x^2) dx propto 1/2 sqrt(pi) e^R erf(x)`</p>

<p>And we know from <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=PExnDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PT242&ots=EPVT5yu6Nx&dq=schuler%20chapman%20approximation&pg=PT242#v=onepage&q=schuler%20chapman%20approximation&f=false">Schüler's work</a> that the limit to our integral as `x->oo` is described by the chapman function when viewing the horizon:</p>

<p>`Ch|| = (1/(2(z-r)) + 1) sqrt((pi (z-r)) / 2)`</p>

So we can refine our estimate to: 

<p>`Ch|| erf(x)` where `z=R` and `x=0`</p>

<p>however if `z=0` then height is linear:</p>

<p>`h = abs(x) - R`</p>

in which case the integral is trivial:

<p>`int_A^L exp(R - x) dx = -exp(R - x)`</p>

We need some way to switch between these two integral solutions seamlessly. We first notice that if we attempt a naïve solution using integration by substitution:

<p>`int_A^L exp(R - sqrt(x^2 + z^2)) dx approx - 1/(h') exp(h(x)) approx - sqrt(x^2 + z^2)/x exp(R - sqrt(x^2 + z^2))`</p>

<p>we see that the division by zero occurs when `x=0`. That only appreciably occurs when `z=R`. So whatever workaround we use to address the division by zero ought to in these circumstance return the approximation from the error function instead of the bogus results from the naïve integration by substitution.</p>

<p>So how about this: we "nudge" the derivative by some amount (let's call it `F`) to prevent division by zero when `x=0`. </p>

<p>`int_A^L exp(R - sqrt(x^2 + z^2)) dx approx - 1/(x/sqrt(x^2 + z^2) + F) exp(R - sqrt(x^2 + z^2))`</p>

<p>When the ray only grazes the planet, `F` should be exactly what's needed to spit out the known good answer, `Ch|| erf(x)`. Since `erf(x)` is close enough to `-exp(R-sqrt(x^2+z^2))`, we'll say:</p>

<p>`F approx 1/(Ch||) = 1 / ((1/(2x) + 1) sqrt((pi x) / 2))` when `x=0` and `z=R`</p>

<p>When the ray strikes head on (`z=0`), the amount we nudge it by should be zero.</p>

<p>`F = 0` when `z = 0`</p>

<p>So all we need is to modify `Ch||` in such a way that F goes to 0 for large values of `x`. We'll call this modification `Ch` I started by calculating `I` using numerical integration and <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/wainnu3qyk">evaluating the expression</a> that was equivalent to `Ch`:</p>

<p>`Ch = (-exp(-h) / I - h')^-1`</p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/iht5vlwov8">some trial and error</a>, I found `Ch approx sqrt(pi/2 (x^2 + z))` works to a suitable approximation, but for those who want more accuracy for a little less performance, it's best to simply to add a linear term onto `Ch||`:</p>

<p>`Ch approx (1/(2 sqrt(x^2+z^2))+1) sqrt(1/2 pi sqrt(x^2+z^2))  + ax`</p>

<p>where I set `a = 0.6`</p>

<p>So in other words, all we're really doing is a modified integration by substitution using the "<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1785715/finding-properties-of-operation-defined-by-x%E2%8A%95y-frac1-frac1x-frac1y">o-plus</a>" operation between `1/h'` and `Ch|| + ax` to prevent division by zero. </p>

<p>`I = int_A^L exp(R-sqrt(x^2 + z^2)) dx approx (1/h' oplus Ch) exp(R-sqrt(x^2 + z^2))`</p>

<p>O-plus turns out to be pretty useful for preventing division by 0, in general.</p>
