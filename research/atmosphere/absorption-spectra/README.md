All charts here were created thanks to the "HITRAN on the Web" website:

x axis is wave number in cm^-1 
y axis is log10 of absorption cross section in cm^2 per molecule
The x axis range is set to whatever was surveyed by HITRAN.
The line profile is set to lorentz where wave number step is the smallest allowed

HITRAN is the gold standard for absorption so I don't think we're going to find 
 a more comprehensive list of absorption cross sections than this.
If this bothers you, either go measure stuff yourself or study up hard on quantum physics
