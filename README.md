Just go [here](http://davidson16807.github.io/tectonics.js/) if you want to mess around with the model.

If you want to run a bleeding edge version of the model locally, download the zipfile [here](https://github.com/davidson16807/tectonics.js/archive/master.zip), unzip the contents, and open "index.html" in the browser of your choice.
