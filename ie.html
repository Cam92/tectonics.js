			<h2>Aw, come on!</h2>
			<p>Are you <i>still</i> using that version of IE?</p>
			<p>Internet Explorer<sup>&reg;</sup> is a software application packaged with the Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> operating system. Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> packages its products with Internet Explorer<sup>&reg;</sup> as a service to users, who may then use the utility to acquire their own choice of web browser.</p>
			<p>All but the most recent versions of Internet Explorer<sup>&reg;</sup> are noncompliant with the international standards that the internet relies upon. Tectonics.js uses state of the art web technologies and as such requires support for the latest web standards, <i>sine qua non</i>. Without a compliant browser the project is simply not possible, and even delivering simple messages such as this one requires work arounds on the developer's behalf.<!--Seriously, IE8 doesn't even read the stupid three.js library without compilation errors.--></p>
			<p>It is strongly advised that you install a compliant web browser. The following are all excellent choices that are easily downloaded at no cost to you, whatsoever. Most browsers here offer autoupdate features that ensure your browser supports even the latest web standards with little or no effort on your part.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Google Chrome</li>
				<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
				<li>Opera</li>
				<li>Apple Safari</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Alternatively, it is currently possible for users to run Tectonics.js on the latest version of Internet Explorer<sup>&reg;</sup>. You may be able to update your version of IE using your copy of the Official Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> Update<sup>&reg;</sup> Utility<sup>&reg;</sup>. <!--welp, no sense in handing out the download link if they already have the utility--> Please note that future support for the current version of IE will not be taken into consideration as the project comes to adopt newer web technologies.</p>
			<p >This probably all comes as one big downer, but cheer up then. Internet explorer offers bar none the best support for scrolling text there is!</p>
