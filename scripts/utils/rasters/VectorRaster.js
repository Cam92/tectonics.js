// VectorRaster represents a grid where each cell contains a vector value. It is a specific kind of a multibanded raster.
// A VectorRaster is composed of two parts
// 		The first is a object of type Grid, representing a collection of vertices that are connected by edges
//  	The second is a structure of arrays (SoA), representing a vector for each vertex within the grid. 
// 
// VectorRaster should theoretically work for any graph of vertices given the appropriate grid object,
// However tectonics.js only uses them with spherical grids.
// 
// VectorRasters can be viewed through several paradigms: vector calculus, math morphology, image editing, etc.
// Each paradigm has its own unique set of operations that can be performed on rasters objects.
// A developer needs to switch between paradigms effortlessly and efficiently, without type conversion.
// Rather than clutter the VectorRaster class, operations on VectorRasters 
// are spread out as friend functions across several namespaces. Each namespace corresponds to a paradigm. 
// This design is meant to promote separation of concerns at the expense of encapsulation.
// I want raster objects to be as bare as possible, functioning more like primitive datatypes.
